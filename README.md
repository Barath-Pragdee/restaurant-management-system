*Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity*
Project Overview

This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests items (such as movies or products) to users based on similarity between features. The system uses cosine similarity to measure how closely related items are and recommends the most relevant ones.

Problem Statement

With large volumes of content available, users often struggle to find items that match their interests. This project aims to solve that problem by recommending similar items based on feature similarity, improving user experience and engagement.

Solution Approach

Preprocess the dataset and extract relevant features

Convert features into numerical vectors

Compute cosine similarity between items

Generate recommendations based on similarity scores

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Key Features

Content-based filtering approach

Efficient similarity computation using cosine similarity

Scalable logic that can be adapted for real-world applications

Project Structure
├── Project_Recommendation_System_Final_Demonstration.ipynb
├── README.md

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the notebook

Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Run the cells sequentially to see data preprocessing, similarity computation, and recommendations

Results

The system successfully recommends relevant items by identifying similar feature patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of cosine similarity for recommendation tasks.

Future Enhancements

Add user-based collaborative filtering

Improve recommendations using hybrid models

Deploy as a web application
